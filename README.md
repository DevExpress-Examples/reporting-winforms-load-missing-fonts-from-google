# Reporting for WinForms - Add missing fonts into DXFontRepository

You can detect and resolve fonts used in documents but are missing in your applicationâ€™s hosting environment (such as various Docker images, Azure App Service, and so on). This helps you ensure that reports appear as designed, regardless of the hosting platform.

The `DXFontRepository.QueryNotFoundFont` event raises for every missing font used in documents. With event args, you can identify and resolve such missing fonts by adding them into DXFontRepository.

You can use the `e.RequestedFont` and `e.ActualFont` properties to identify fonts in the application. To add a missing font, provide a byte array that contains font data to `e.FontFileData` to add missing fonts to the `DXFontRepository` before document generation begins. 

You can add fonts from anywhere. The `FontCollectorService.cs` is an example of a custom service that asynchronously adds missing fonts from Google Fonts into `DXFontRepository`.
