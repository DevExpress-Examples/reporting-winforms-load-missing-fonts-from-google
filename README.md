# Reporting for WinForms - Add missing fonts into DXFontRepository from Google

You can detect and resolve fonts used in documents but are missing in your applicationâ€™s hosting environment (such as various Docker images, Azure App Service, and so on). This helps you ensure that reports appear as designed, regardless of the hosting platform.

You can add fonts from anywhere. The `FontCollectorService.cs` is an example of a custom service that asynchronously adds missing fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) into [DXFontRepository](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/404255/devexpress-drawing-library/use-font-repository-to-add-custom-fonts?v=24.2). 

> [!Note]
> Google Fonts are open-source, but be sure to read the associated license agreement to determine usage rights for your particular use case.

The report contains the following Google fonts that are not common and can be missed in your hosting environment: _Ga Maamli_, _Roboto_, and _Nerko One_. The exported [result.pdf](result.pdf) file illustrates that missing fonts are successfully downloaded and available in the report:

## Example Details

The [DXFontRepository.QueryNotFoundFont](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.Drawing.DXFontRepository.QueryNotFoundFont?v=24.2) event raises for every missing font used in documents. With event args, you can identify and resolve such missing fonts by adding them into DXFontRepository.

You can use the `e.RequestedFont` and `e.ActualFont` properties to identify fonts in the application. To add a missing font to the `DXFontRepository` before document generation begins, prepare a byte array that contains font data and pass it to `e.FontFileData`. 

> [!Important]
> You need a personal developer API key to use the code from the example. See [Developer API](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api). 
>
> Add the API key to `apiKey` variable in the [FontCollectorService.cs](./CS/LoadMissingFonts/FontCollectorService.cs#L19) file before you launch the example.
